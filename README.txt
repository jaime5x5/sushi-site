Sushi-site

RESEARCH: What problems exist? Why a redesign?
	Intro looks nice but not relevent. Site needs reorganized so primary user objectives are prominently available.


USERS: Who are the users?
	platform: Desktop and mobile friendly.
	usage: 	a. Checking for what is in the area (yelp).
			b. Sushi seekers.

DESIGN: What are your solutions to these problems?

	Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. 
	Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
	Drop the intro and go single page.
